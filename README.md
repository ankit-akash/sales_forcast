# Sales Prediction with Linear Regression

Predicting future sales is a critical task for businesses looking to optimize their operations and make informed decisions. This repository houses a robust machine learning project that leverages Linear Regression to forecast sales, utilizing Python and its powerful data science libraries.

## Key Features

- **Linear Regression Model**: I've implemented a Linear Regression algorithm to create accurate sales predictions based on past data from 2013-2018.

- **Data Preprocessing**: Our project showcases comprehensive data preprocessing techniques, including data cleaning, feature engineering, and normalization, to ensure the model's reliability.

- **Data Visualization**: We provide insightful data visualizations that help you better understand the underlying trends in your sales data.

- **Model Evaluation**: We've used various evaluation metrics to assess the model's performance, ensuring that it meets real-world requirements.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**: Clone this repository and set up a Python environment.

2. **Data**: You can use your own dataset, but I have included a sample dataset for demonstration which is from ***Kaggle***.

3. **Notebooks**: Explore our Jupyter notebooks or Google Colab to understand the data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation process.

4. **Training the Model**: Follow the code examples to train your own Linear Regression model on the provided dataset or your own which u can find online.

5. **Predictions**: Learn how to make sales predictions using your trained model.

## Evaluation Metrics

I have used standard evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared to measure the model's performance.
